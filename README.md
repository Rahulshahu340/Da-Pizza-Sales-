Da-Pizza Sales - Data Analysis

# Phase 1: SQL Analysis – Advanced Queries
In this phase, the focus was on extracting, cleaning, and analyzing the raw sales data from Da Pizza's database using SQL. Advanced queries were written to:

Filter and Aggregate Data: The raw data was filtered to focus on relevant information such as specific time periods, pizza categories, and sales amounts.
Joins & Subqueries: Complex joins were used to combine different data tables (e.g., orders, products, and customer details) to create comprehensive views.
Calculated Metrics: SQL queries calculated key metrics like Total Revenue, Average Order Value, Total Pizzas Sold, and Average Pizzas per Order.
Data Transformation: Data was transformed into a more usable format for further analysis, ensuring that insights would be accurate and actionable.
# Phase 2: Data Visualization – Power BI
Once the data was prepared in SQL, the next phase involved Power BI to create interactive visualizations and dashboards. In this phase:

Data Import: Cleaned and aggregated data from the SQL analysis phase was imported into Power BI.
Dashboard Design: Visuals were created to represent KPIs, such as Total Revenue, Total Orders, and Average Order Value, in a clear and intuitive way using charts, graphs, and tables.
Interactive Reports: Power BI allowed for interactive features such as slicers and filters, enabling stakeholders to explore the data from different angles (e.g., by region, time period, or product category).
Trend Analysis: Visualizations like trend charts and maps were designed to reveal patterns in sales, customer behavior, and product performance over time.
